# Old-Discord-Fonts
Discord now uses gg sans instead of Whitney as their main font and a lot of people have complained about it, so I've restored the old font with css.

If you use discord on browser, get the [stylebot](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylebot/oiaejidbmkiecgbjeifoejpgmdaleoha) extension and Go to open the stylebot menu by clicking the extension and `Open Stylebot`. Copy/paste the contents of [this file](https://github.com/SpiritAxolotl/Old-Discord-Fonts/blob/main/Discord%20Old%20Fonts/discord-overwrite-css.css) in a new style for `discord.com` or other subdomains discord owns, and voila you got the old font back wooo.
Alternatively if you use discord on client, you can most definitely use [BetterDiscord](https://betterdiscord.app/)'s custom CSS menu, but do so at your own risk.
